            var textString = "ME: Ok I hit record already. Cool. HIM: Uh huh.  ME: Ok. Ummmmm…[video plays]  ME: I have to make a separate file for JavaScript. Right? HIM: Yeah.  ME: Okay. But you said you don't do front end stuff. HIM: I don't. I know nothing about front end. You know more about front end than I do.  ME: But then how do you…do you just remember that I have to make a new file for it? HIM: Yeah. [video plays]  ME: Oh, wa-wait. But I think I was supposed to download this thing. [video plays] CDN? Uhhhhhh help. Is it this thing? Is it that thing? HIM: Yeah, I think so.  ME: It's this? HIM: Yeah.  ME: Copy. Paste. [video plays] Oh. Oh, wait. I'm not supposed to add it to it. Oh, wait. Where where where am I adding this? Down here? Paste. Okay. [video plays]  ME: Oh my god. So do you ever find my train of thought hard to follow? HIM: I don't think so.  ME: Really? HIM: Yeah.  ME: Even when I get really weird and kooky about it? HIM: It's less about it's never really like your train of thought is hard to follow.  ME: Uh-huh. HIM: It's more of sometimes your train of thought is-isn’t viable.  ME: What do you mean it's not viable? HIM: Not-  ME: You're not viable. HIM: Not at this specifically, but in general.  ME: Wait. Wait. Wait. Pause. Let me [video plays] What the freak is that? Dude, what is that? HIM: What are those?  ME: What's a var typed? Oh my god. New typed. [video plays]  ME: What’s a class name? HIM: Hmmmm?  ME: What’s a class name? HIM: What do you mean?  ME: Meaning when I code, what's a class name? HIM: The name of the class, isn't it?  ME: What's a class? HIM: Well, aren't you just copying and pasting what he's doing?  ME: Okay. Well, explain this to me because I'm not- HIM: Well copy and paste that first, and then maybe I can understand it.  ME: Bruv HIM: What? [video plays]  ME: What? Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Span? Bruv. [video plays]  ME: Oh my god. What's happening? Oh, this just entered a realm that I don't understand. HIM: You're doing great.  ME: Oh my god. Things made sense up until this point. HIM: You're doing great.  ME: No. HIM: You're doing great.  ME: *coughs* [video plays]  ME: Auto type. Auto type. [video plays] Okay. So do I get rid of that? [video plays] Oh my god. What the hell? Dot auto type. [video plays] Oh my god. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Comma. [video plays] Wait. What the freak? Wait. What? HIM: Huh?  ME: Oh my god. SOS. HIM: What do you mean?  ME: What is happening? HIM: What do you mean SOS?  ME: What's a string? HIM: A string is the words.  ME: But I'm already typing words. Why would you need a HIM: No. Like, the words that you wanna show up on the screen.  ME: Oh, that's not in the header anymore? Why not? HIM: Because you wanna animate it, right?  ME: Oh, yeah. Oh, strings. [video plays] *Salem meows*  ME: Wait. Wait. Wait. So this guy…this guy in the tutorial is only animating, like…like, single words, right? So if I want if I want our whole conversation to be animated, does that mean that I only have one set of quotes with our whole conversation in between the quotes. HIM: No idea. We'll figure it out when we actually see what auto type actually does.  ME: Oh my god. HIM: Like, just get-when is this due again?  ME: Well, by the end of October, but I wanna, like, get things started though. HIM: Well, this is getting things started. Get this out and see what it does then we play with it and see what it does, and we go from there.  ME: What do you mean play with it? HIM: We change some things and see what it does. So just do this for now. Just follow this-follow this word for word for now, okay?  ME: Why would you change things? HIM: So we can figure out how to do to figure out to how to do what we actually wanna do.  ME: Changing things is scary. HIM: Yeah. But you'll figure it out. We'll figure it out.  ME:*cries* No. [video plays] HIM: Poop is the third word.  ME: *wheezes* Stop Both: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  ME: That’s being added. Philsies this is all being-this is all going in my project! HIM: You said you could filter it out.  ME: Maybe. HIM: You like that line.  ME: Okay. Well, alright. Alright. Okay. *wheezes* So you don’t-you don't think that my, like, way of thinking ever confuses you. HIM: No. It's just when you when you are describing stuff, I'm busy trying to think of how we can create what you wanna do. And I'm just like, how did we jump over the Grand Canyon?  ME: What do you mean? I don't jump over any Grand Canyons. HIM: Yeah. You expect me to.  ME: Wow. *wheezes* That makes me sound like a slave driver or something. HIM: It’s a “oh si oh no.”  ME: No. I don't have unrealistic expectations of you. I just think in my head that you know how to do a lot because you're, like, super smart. So, therefore, your…your brain should match your output, right? In my head, that's how it goes. Right? Dude, you're not paying attention. HIM: I’m trying to find a video for my reaction.  ME: You're not paying attention to me. HIM: Hold on. [video plays]  ME: Oh my god. [video plays] HIM: This is my reaction sometimes when we talk. [video continues playing] Me; Oh, okay. Save. Okay. Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Oh, noice! Why is there a big gap? Wait. I don't want it to erase. Wait. How do-HIM: Well, we’ll just look at it for now.  ME: How do I get it to not erase? HIM: So go back to the VSCode. Ummmm…get rid of back speed or get rid of no looping.  ME: Get rid…false? HIM: Yeah. Probably false.  ME: Save. Oh, okay. Nice. Nice. Nice. Okay. So it it it it types out whatever is in the quotes. HIM: Mhmm.  ME: So if I like okay. Let's do, like, a wait. Wait. HIM: What happens if you put a new string?  ME: What's a new string? HIM: Wait go back to it. Go back to it. Press comma after ipsum.  ME: Right here? HIM: Yeah. And do new quotes.  ME: New quotes. HIM: And type something else. Alright.  ME: Bleh bleh bleh. Save. HIM: Now go back to the thing. Both: OHHHHHHHHH  ME: Oh, I don't want that. I just want continuous, like so so then it all just goes in the same quotes then, right? HIM: Here. Let's go back to this then.  ME: Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. HIM: Yeah. You can just say everything in the same quotes, but then you want it like a conversation, right, where it goes, like, left to right, left to right?  ME: Oh, you can do that? HIM: Well, I don't know if you can. But, like, you want it to, like like, as if it were, like, a text message conversation. Right?  ME: Sure. I mean HIM: Or is it just a long blah?  ME: Ideally, I guess it would be left to right. Oh my god. That's a long ass-does it can is there a way to-HIM: Maybe.  ME: Do I have to leave it like that? Oh god. That makes me uncomfy. HIM: Just leave it like that. Remember, love, this is coding. This is not book design.  ME: Okay. So it types-it types everything out that's in the quotes HIM: Yeah.  ME: All at once. HIM: Yeah. *burps*  ME: So…so is there a way for you to do, like, left and right, left and right? HIM: Maybe.  ME: Is-is that a thing? HIM: Maybe. Yeah. Let me see.  ME: I also want this to go faster. HIM: Just increase type speed.  ME: Oh, okay. Wait. HIM: Hold on real quick. Uhhhhhh…body class container. Oh, okay.  ME: Wow. You already got that? That was because I thought we needed to make another file for the JavaScript. But I forgot that you could put the JavaScript, like, in the HTML. HIM: Ohhh…Okeydokey.  ME: Okay. What do I do? HIM: Well, I thought you wanted to change this type speed.  ME: Oh, yes. Let's do, like, 250 and see what that is. HIM: That doesn't seem that much faster.  ME: That’s still too slow. 550. HIM: Maybe lower  ME: Wait. What? HIM: Try lowering it.  ME: How the freak does that make sense? Oh, damn. Okay. Wow. That- HIM: Yeah. I was like 250 seems slower than 150.  ME: That jumps really fast. HIM: Well, I mean-  ME: Let’s do 100? HIM: Yeah.  ME: Okay. There we go. I like that speed. HIM: Oh! Who the freak designed this variable name? I think that might be milliseconds between letters.  ME: How the freak did you get that? HIM: Because when you increased it, it went slower.  ME: Yeah. But where do you-there’s no unit or anything. How the freak do you get- HIM: Well, it's generally milliseconds. If there's no unit and it's time encoding, it's generally milliseconds unless they're ridiculous, and they're using nanos. But it's probably milliseconds.  ME: Okay. HIM: Like, if you do a 1,000  ME: Okay. Sure. HIM: Just try a 1,000 real quick.  ME: Why? HIM: I'm testing it. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back.  ME: Do you need to test it? HIM: Yes.  ME: Why? HIM: Because this is part of the logical ones. Yeah. So it's milliseconds.  ME: Oh my god. HIM: It's milliseconds.  ME: No. That's ridiculous. HIM: Let's get it back to a 100.  ME: Oh, shoot. I deleted too much. Okay. There we go. HIM: And then now it's 10 characters a second.  ME: Okay. Well, I don't it's like black magic. Okay. Okay. So then how do you do left right, left right? HIM: Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  ME: Hehehehehehe. HIM: Wait. So how did you get well, you showed an example where there was scrolling involved.  ME: Yeah. HIM: How can we show scrolling?  ME: Wouldn’t the scroll just naturally happen once it, like, hits enough text? Right? HIM: Will it? Here. Let me, make your window narrower.  ME: Well, it has to oh, it stopped. HIM: Yeah. Just I'll make it shorter too.  ME: Make it shorter. Okay. HIM: Alright. Now refresh.  ME: Refresh. HIM: I don't think it scrolls auto.  ME: Oh, I don't want it to scroll auto. HIM: Oh, oh, you don't want it to auto scroll? So you're scrolling it?  ME: Yeah, why not? HIM: Oh.  ME: I mean, as long as you can, like- HIM: Oh.  ME: It's fine if it doesn't scroll. HIM: Ohhhhhhhhhh.  ME: But, like, the left right left right thing is intriguing. I like that. HIM: Alright.  ME: How do you do that? Do I have to make a new class? Like, a new div? Because I think right now, this-the isn't this div for that guy? Right? Or no? Doesn't this- HIM: Yeah. That div is for that guy.  ME: Okay. HIM: So you could make a new div and then just have each div, like, have one side of the screen.  ME: Yeah. Okay. Wait. How do I wait-Is it justify? Justify content left? HIM: That’s, that's HTML. Use your Myspace skills.  ME: I think-dude, HIM: I didn't do Myspace, bro. The only the only HTML I learned was in the 3rd was in a computer camp in 3rd grade.  ME: I want oh my god. Wait. So the width shouldn't be a 100% then. HIM: Probably 50.  ME: 50. Alright, let’s see if this worked. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. So then so then I make a new div. Right? I make a new div. Making a new div. I'm gonna do, like, container 2. HIM: Mhmm.  ME: Container 2. Save. And then here, I go-oh my god-I go dot container 2 bracket. Copy. Paste. Justify for this guy. Right. Save. Nothing is showing up. HIM: What do you mean?  ME: Where's the right one? HIM: Did you put another typed in the right one?  ME: Oh, no. I didn't. Oopsie daisies. Uhhh wait. Then maybe I should do this too. Dot container 2. Okay. Save. Okay. Uhhhh…So then what do I do I copy paste, like, this section? HIM: Yeah. Wait. Where does this script go? The script goes in there.  ME: But-Yeah. Script goes in here, but, like, the auto type is…help. HIM: Oh, yeah yeah. Make a new type. Make a new, like, an like, just copy the script portion.  ME: Like, this whole thing? HIM: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  ME: Copy. Paste. HIM: Yeah. And then do auto type.  ME: Oh, lord. Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Oh my god. HIM: What did you do?  ME: What did I do? HIM: Okay. Go back. Go back. Print. Copy, paste? Yeah. Copy, paste.  ME: Copy. Paste. HIM: Yes. K. Name it auto type 2.  ME: Up here and down there? HIM: Yeah.  ME: Auto type 2. Auto oh, auto type 2. HIM: Yeah. Now try that.  ME: Save. Uhhhh…HIM: Did you you may not have set it up correctly.  ME: What? HIM: Back to your CSS.  ME: But I said justify right. What? HIM: Ummmmmm…How do you put the-how do you put the how do you put containers next to each other?  ME: I don't know. *wheezes* You uhhhhhh….well, I don't want it necessarily, like, next to each other. I just want it, like like, here. *hiss* You okay? HIM: Funny bone.  ME: Oh, no. HIM: Like, I I just want it, like, here.  ME: Yeah. HIM: And, like, not down here.  ME: Also, like, why is this justified? I said justify right. HIM: Does justify it right do does justify do what you think it does?  ME: I thought it did. HIM: Like I said, I don't know very much about HTML or CSS. ME: Justify content CSS. HIM: Alright. We'll be back.  ME: Oh, shoot. Maybe it doesn’t. Oh, shoot. Wait. So then how do I oh my god. It's been a while. Is it align? Align items? HIM: Align sounds correct.  ME: Align items. Uhhhhhh…Oh my god. Wait. Okay. CSS. What is it? CSS. Uhhhhhhh…move text to right. How do you do this? How do you do this? Oh, what the hell? Wait. Padding left? 3p wait. What does this mean? HIM: What? Where? Shouldn’t you be looking at the answer?  ME: Oh, text align? Oh my god. HIM: Can you try that?  ME: Text align. Jesus. For a oh my god. I haven't done this in such a long time. Okay. Alright. Alright. Let's test it now. I done effed up. HIM: What happened?  ME: What the frick is that? HIM: Oh, the text is aligned to the right. Is it not?  ME: Wait. Is it? Oh, my god. It is. HIM: It is not text aligned.  ME: Okay. No. No. No. Okay. Wait. That's part of it. Because it is aligned to the Yeah. But I needed to scooch it all the way. Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. How how do I do this? Oh, my God. HIM: Oh, can you do, like, position? Like, isn't that, like, a left or, like, position left, position x or something like that?  ME: Position right? Is that a thing? HIM: I don't know.  ME: I don't know. Nope. Oh my god. How do I search it, though? CSS move. HIM: CSS container position?  ME: Container position. HIM: Yeah. Try that.  ME: Position. Oh, I remember Omar saying that we should never do position absolute. HIM: Oh, yeah. Because that means that you change oh, it's left. I think what you look for is left.  ME: Oh, is but I think I have to add that first, right? Position relative? HIM: Yeah.  ME: Jesus Christ, dude. Okay. Right. *coughs* Bruh, I don't know if that changed anything. I don't think that changed anything. HIM: Alright. Well, let's go back to it. What did we do?  ME: I said position relative and then, like, I don't know what that means. HIM: Wait. Hold highlight over right again. But, like so it says how far…so look.  ME: Okay. What does that mean? HIM: Go back to train of thought HTML. HIM: Right here. Wait.  ME: *sips tea* HIM: So alright. Now to put 2 that way. Now to put 2 2 position, 2 divs, side by side.  ME: Wait. But I don't want them, like, side by side like that. HIM: You can always move one up and down.  ME: Oh, I can? HIM: I'm sure you can.  ME: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think I can. I think I can. But I just, bruv. What the freak? HIM: Oh, so what if-what if here. Let me see. Can I see your laptop?  ME: Oh, yes. But you have to make sure that you can still be recorded. HIM: You can still hear me. I promise.  ME: We're we're going on to 24 minutes. HIM: Pass me the laptop.  ME: Okay. HIM: I'm on the sofa and comfy. I'm unplugging it.  ME: Okay. HIM: So I lost my phone.  ME: You can see the example. HIM: Yeah. Okay.  ME: Wait. You know what to do? HIM: I have a guess.  ME: Oh, for real? Dude, I don't know how you did that so quickly. HIM: So then what if oh, it's called container and container 1. Div. Div. Div.  ME: Oh. I was supposed to answer the vice versa question. HIM: Yes.  ME: Yeah. I find your brain very intriguing and your way of thinking very confusing. HIM: Why is that?  ME: I don't know because like I don't know. You're like logical to the point where sometimes I'm like it doesn't make sense. HIM: Why is that?  ME: I don't know because I think like because I'm not used to thinking in that way. Like it's like how I keep telling you that I'm like super visual. Right? And then like when you explain something to me I need to be able to see it, otherwise I cannot see it the way that you see it in your brain. HIM: Yeah.  ME: Like, I think similarly, like, I don't follow your train of thought sometimes because it's like like way too like straightforward and and like logical to the point where I'm like, I don't know that doesn't it's almost like it doesn't vibe with me. *wheezes* HIM: Interesting.  ME: As weird of a of a response that is. Dude nothing's happening. HIM: I know. I'm thinking thinking.  ME: I thought you said you knew what you were doing. HIM: I thought I did.  ME: Oh. HIM: But  ME: Well, you can go back to the example. HIM: Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  ME: Bro, once upon a time, I knew how to do this. I'm working late because I'm a designer. I got the text to align right.  HIM: Mhmm.  ME: That's something hahahahahaha.  HIM: Relative. Yeah. Okay. Let's just try that. Top and left.   ME: Didn't we try that?  HIM: Yeah. But let's see what okay. Let's move   ME: WHY ARE YOU DELETING THINGS? HIM: I'm not deleting things. You gots to chills. Thrills for the pils [pilsners].   ME: Do you have the thrills for the pils? Are you obsessed with Pilsners too? Have you had a Pilsner?  HIM: Yeah.   ME: Oh, I don't think I've ever had a Pilsner. I'm working late because I’m a designer. Wait. So then every new piece of, like, dialogue that is currently coming out right now  HIM: Yeah.   ME: Like like, you know okay. Like, you know BuzzFeed Unsolved. Right? You know how when they go into the blue and yellow text? Right?  HIM: Yeah.   ME: Like, I want something kinda like that. So does that mean every single time I, like, start, OH YOU DID IT!  HIM: I don't know how I can time it.   ME: I don't care about timing, honestly, at this point.  HIM: Okay.   ME: It's fine. But, like okay. So back to my back to my question.  HIM: Your question.   ME: So does that mean that, like, every time I wanna switch between, like, me talking, you talking, me talking, you talking, right, I have to make a new freaking, like, div and container? HIM: Potentially.   ME: Oh, lord.  HIM: Like, because well, but see, that's the thing, though. Like   ME: Oh lord.  HIM: Are they all typing at the same time?  ME: Sure. Yeah. Why not? Let's just I'm not trying to make this, like, super complicated. You know? HIM: Okay. Then, yeah, we could just make it so that the divs are all just, just, like, all like, the the conversations all happening at the exact same time.   ME: Yeah. But then just, like, one side is you and  HIM: Yeah.   ME: One side is me.  HIM: Yeah.  ME: Okay.  HIM: And then I'll just go you can just scroll down.   ME: Yeah. Okay. Chill. Amazing.  HIM: Slash we’ll need to play with some dimensions because this is cutting this off.   ME: Oh, it is? Is that being cut off or is that the actual word? HIM: No. It's belly Oh. I T and then this is   ME: Okay. You do that then.  HIM: I don't know.  ME: I think it has something to do with paaaaaadding.  HIM: I'm sure it's also   ME: But I also have it set to like 50% So you could, like, maybe  HIM: Yeah. Make it 45.   ME: Yeah.  HIM: Let's make this also 45.  ME: You can speed up the  HIM: Yeah. Let's make this like   ME: Oh, wow. That's speedy. Oh, it's not cut off anymore.  HIM: Yeah.  ME: Cool. Yeah. That works. Yes.  HIM: Okay.  ME: And then I  HIM: Yeah can make a bunch of things.   ME: Yeah.  HIM: Now as for ohhhhh hmmmmm. How do we add strings to each one in a way that makes sense?   ME: What do you mean? HIM: Like, if you wanna randomize the thing. You know?   ME: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For, like, one of the okay.  HIM: Wait. But then I feel like real quick. If we're going back and forth if it's a conversation jawns then that means there's a lot of breaking points back and forth.   ME: Okay. Wait. Then what if what if I got a brain blast. What if this side is, like, the part that makes sense and then the right side is the jumbled up part? HIM: Sure.   ME: So that, like just to make it easier on everybody.  HIM: Yeah.   ME: And then  HIM: So it's just the flow and conversation on both sides.   ME: Yeah. Sure.  HIM: Yeah. We could probably do something like that.   ME: Okay. So how do we jumble this up?  HIM: Errrrrrr…jambalaya.   ME: I don't think that's a coding thing. *sniffs* Is it? That's your profession, not mine. HIM: Mhmm.   ME: Because I'm working late because I'm a designer. Oh, he looks so cute. Wrapped round my finger. My twisted humor. Make him laugh so often. Wow, Google. Wait. Let's get another question real quick. Heheheh. Okay. Uhhhhhhh well, we answered that one. Oh, when faced with a challenge, how do you prioritize finding the most efficient solution versus considering a more innovative or unusual approach? Or I guess it's like wait. No. I feel like a better question is like like when you're faced with a challenge, do you go at it like thinking with your head or thinking with your emotions? Like head versus heart, you know?  HIM: For what's the situation?   ME: It's like a challenge.  HIM: Yeah. Well, what type of challenge?  ME: I don't think that matters????  HIM: No. Like, it was a work challenge.   ME: Bruv, no. It's just a challenge. HIM: No. But if it's like a work challenge, it's always the head.   ME: I feel like not always.  HIM: No. For coding, it's always the head.  ME: Oh, well, I mean just like I feel like you want to think logically like most of the time but then I feel like some of the time like like feel like doing what you feel is right also has its merits.  HIM: Yeah. But in coding, that's generally what is right is you have to think about logically why is that right.   ME: Oh, well, that's not every job.  HIM: Yeah. But in coding, that's   ME: For example, me trying to me on a warpath against all the people who are freaking vaping indoors.  HIM: Mhmm.   ME: *sips tea* I feel like that's like a combo of like thinking with your head. Bless you. Thinking with your head and like thinking with emotions. HIM: Mhmm.   ME: Because it's fundamentally wrong to do so.  HIM: Yeah.   ME: You know, but then also like logically wrong. Logically wrong to do so but also technically like just thinking about others in the same space as you like you know. HIM: Mhmm.   ME: Like be a good person. Because legit with those people logic has failed them clearly.  HIM: Mhmm.   ME: Do you know what you're doing yet? HIM: Maybe.   ME: Okay. Do you want me to not talk?  HIM: I'm just trying to think about what we oh, wait. We can change this. Interesting. Alright. You can place it in.   ME: What does that mean? Oh, is this the same GitHub page that I got up earlier? Okay.  HIM: You can pause.   ME: Should I do that?  HIM: It's up to you.   ME: When would I need to pause the type? HIM: I don't know. But, customization. Strings. These are default values. Strings element. Type Yeah. I was right milliseconds! Look at that.   ME: Wow.  HIM: Start delay.  ME: You're so smart.  HIM: Backspace one doesn't match the previous string. Ohhhhhh. Fade out. No. Okay. Loop loop loop loop loop. Lalalalalalala.   ME: Oh, he's knocked out.  HIM: Uh-huh.   ME: Like, face planted on the pillow.  HIM: That's strange.   ME: *sniffs* HIM: One string type after each string is typed. Before it begins typing. Begin.   ME: My twisted humor. Make him laugh so often.  HIM: After each   ME: Oh, I need to buy gray paper. Shoot. Okay. What else did I need to order from Amazon? I forgot it in my order. That's something that I needed to crap. Oh, I finally bought a rotary cutter. HIM: Mhmm.   ME: Yeah.  HIM: Okeydokey. How can you how to randomize? Uhhhhhh how to randomize. Randomize string order. So JS. Alright. In JavaScript, how do we do this?   ME: This is gibberish. Bro, it's amazing. Look. 1 year in between 2 of these could do. Once upon a time, this would not be gibberish. HIM: Okay. Let's see. Okey dokey. So what if we do typed strings?   ME: *yawns*  HIM: Right? Read string from HTML.   ME: So you're saying you always think with your head first.  HIM: Yeah. For work.   ME: Even with me?  HIM: No. I said it for work.   ME: So you apply certain types of thinking logic or methods to certain things in your life.  HIM: Yeah.   ME: So with work, you always think with your head.  HIM: Yeah.   ME: But then with me, what happens?  HIM: Then it's come then it's a lot more gotta be a lot more creative.   ME: How so?  HIM: Because you gotta be creative with the wifeskies.   ME: Like, what do you mean?  HIM: Because, like, it's not always just what's right, but what will make you feel the best. You know what I mean?   ME: Ah.  HIM: Like, for like, a lot of times in relationships, it's less about like, it's less about be getting to the right answer, but it's about being heard and being felt.  ME: Wow. Look at you, doctor Phil.  HIM: If you know what I mean.   ME: Doctor Phil, STOP! This is going into my freaking homework.  HIM: You said you can filter it.   ME: I'm not filtering it that much, homie.  HIM: Well, I mean, how are you are you how are you gonna parse this from audio to text?   ME: I was literally just transcribing. I'm using, like, the same transcribing software that I use with the, like, the  HIM: Doesn't that only give you 10 minutes for free?  ME: I'm not listening to this and writing down word for word.  HIM: Yeah so what are you gonna do for the rest of the 20 minutes there, love?   ME: I mean, I might look for another software.  HIM: Nice.   ME:*sniffs* I feel like wait. So do you think I use my head more or use my emotions more HIM: Depends.   ME: When I think.  HIM: Depends.   ME: Depends. Depends on what? HIM: Depends on the situation.   ME: Oh my god.  HIM: Wait. Hold on. I'm trying to get, parse from string.  ME: You're supposed to be trying to explain this to me, dude.  HIM: Yeah. I know, but I'm trying to figure out how to even do something.   ME: Oh, okay.  HIM: Abstract text.  ME: Okay. Well, when you figure it out, I'm gonna re…  HIM: K.  ME: Did you get it to work? Oh, wow. It did. How?  HIM: And it changes every time.  ME: Wait. Wait. Wait. How? Wait. Wait. Wait. Go back.  HIM: So   ME: Explain it.  HIM: So this is the string. This is our wonderful lorem ipsum.   ME: Yeah.  HIM: And then so what we do is we split it up.  ME: Okay.  HIM: So this splits up the string   ME: Okay.  HIM: At the space.   ME: Okay.  HIM: So it effectively makes it. So this is, like, one big string. This makes it a, collection. So now lorem is a thing, ipsum is a thing, dolor is a thing, sit is a thing, amet with the comma.   ME: Okay.  HIM: Who cares about syntax here. And then this just randomizes it.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: I'm not exactly sure how this works.   ME: Okay.  HIM: Oh, I think this is just oh, yeah. This is where it just randomly sorts it. That's just a way to do it, randomly.   ME: Okay.  HIM: And then this takes this list of words   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: And puts them all back together with a space.  ME: Oh, wow.  HIM: So now   ME: Wow.  HIM: For the left side, we put the text string, which is the normal text.   ME: Okay.  HIM: And then for the right side, we put scrambled, which is the scrambled text.  ME: So where my oh. Oh. So the the conversation just goes here. Oh, okay. I see. HIM: And that builds everything out.   ME: Ohhhhhhh, wow. Amazing. Good job, Philsies. Proud of you. *high five* Yay.  HIM: Here you go.   ME: We finished. People are gonna think you're so intelligent. How did you figure this out, though?  HIM: Google.   ME: Oh, you just Googled it?  HIM: Yep.   ME: Oh, okay. HIM: That's all coding is. Coding is about knowing the right   ME: Hey, yo. What? It says your permission is required to connect your device to TV. What what device is trying to connect to our TV?  HIM: Someone probably is connecting to the wrong   ME: What the hell? Are we being hacked?  HIM: No. Someone's probably   ME: Deny. Away, you evil creature.  HIM: Someone probably I mean, Samsung is this Samsung. This is Samsung right?   ME: I don't know. Is it? It looks like this is my. HIM: Samsung TVs are dirt cheap, so they probably are somewhere in the area. They're probably like one of our neighbors and are trying to connect to their own TV.   ME: They're not trying to hack us?  HIM: No.   ME: Okay. Wow. The fact that you understood what was happening is wild.  HIM: Coding is literally just can you figure out the right questions to ask and then copy and paste.  ME: But I feel like coding, like, coders require a specific I don't know. Like, a specific way of, like, looking at words that, like, I can't relate to or I don't know what that is.  HIM: Nah. So the thing is with coding is it's it's not great for you because you don't like going into some thing where things are unknown.   ME: Yeah. HIM: Coding a lot of time oh, man. I pressed the wrong button. A lot of times with the coding   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: It's kind of about   ME: It's kind of about?  HIM: Understanding that, like, some things you're not gonna know   ME: Uh-huh. HIM: Until you get there.   ME: What does that mean?  HIM: So, like, here, like, I didn't understand a lot of, like, the the randomization code.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: Until I actually put it in. But I was like, okay. I know that this does this. I don't know how it does it. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't matter to me how it does it. I I just know it does it.  ME: Okay. So  HIM: Which is something you're not you're not fun you're not comfortable with.   ME: Yeah.  HIM: Like, for you, you need to know how it does something the whole way.   ME: Yeah. HIM: But with coding, like, especially if you're doing something new, like, when you look something up.  ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: Like, you at the start, all you really need to know is that something does something.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: Not how it does it.   ME: Okay.  HIM: So then you can learn to understand what you need to understand. A lot of time it is is understanding the bare minimum of what you need to do.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: Before you can move on.   ME: So how do you figure out what something is doing then?  HIM: Oh, once you have everything built out to what you need to do, then you look into it.   ME: Oh. HIM: So that's why why I was like, oh, you gotta play with it. Like, when you're like, oh, like, can we figure out what we're doing, like, when you were first writing everything?   ME: Yeah.  HIM: You wanna go pee first?   ME: No. HIM: Are you sure?   ME: Yeah.  HIM: Like, when you're like, oh, like, we need to figure out what to do.   ME: Uh-huh. HIM: And my my mindset was, we gotta just get something, like, a in a website up, a web page up   ME: Yeah.  HIM: That does anything. And then we can change it.  ME: Mhmm.  HIM: Because that's the whole mindset with coding. You gotta do something.   ME: Uh-huh. HIM: And once, like, the code just runs, then you can change the code to do what you wanna do.   ME: Interesting. HIM: Because, like, with coding, there's general in general. In general, there is such little cost in trying something.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: That it's almost always better to just cobble stuff together and try it and then make it better.   ME: What, well, that's kinda like book design, though. Like, a lot of the times, I get, like, the bits and pieces of, like, what a book should be or what's included in the book, and then I, like, have to play around with it in InDesign, like, you know, like, figure out the placement and, like, massage it, like, the margins and, like, the spacing and the whatnot and the leading and all that fun stuff. But, like so then  HIM: how but I mean, you could view it like that. Yeah.   ME: Yeah. But then, technically, I, like, in I'm not fully aware about how this thing is gonna turn out or, like, what’s- HIM: Yeah. But okay. Instead of but but I view it more as imagine you were doing book design.   ME: Mhmm.  HIM: And you were, like, changing, like, the size of the margins.   ME: Yeah. HIM: But when, like, say say you've never used InDesign before.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: And you didn't understand the word margin.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: And when you first set up your book, I don't know how InDesign works. But when you say when you first set up your book, it says, oh, how big do you want your margins?  ME: It does ask you that.  HIM: Oh, sure. It does ask that.   ME: Yeah.  HIM: But say you didn't know you know, you're using design and you don't know what the word margin means. So you don't know what a margin is. Right?   ME: Okay.  HIM: Yeah. Like, how you would be right now would be you'd be looking up   ME: I would Google. HIM: You'd Google.   ME: What is a margin?  HIM: What is a margin? What does this do? Yeah.  ME: Yeah. Yeah.  HIM: And, like, what happens if I do this? What should it be? What's ideally should it be right here, right now?   ME: Yeah.  HIM: My mindset is, well, this is all digital. Hit a random number. See what happens.  ME: NO! But then but then in book design, once you start designing and you have your layout, right, in your in your system and whatnot, like and then like, for example, with freaking Greenville, them saying, like, oh, we want the dimensions of the book to be, like, bigger.  HIM: Yeah.   ME: That means my entire, like, design literally has to be, like, changed and revamped and, like  HIM: That's also a big part of it. In coding   ME: There's, like, permanence to book design a little bit. HIM: Like In coding, there is some degree that, like, once you go with a certain design, it's kinda hard to change it.   ME: Yeah.  HIM: But, like, it's definitely easier to change in general stuff  in coding than it is in design. Because, like, yeah, like, if you change your book size   ME: Yeah.  HIM: That's hours, if not days.  ME: The biggest pain in the ass.  HIM: It's hours, if not days   ME: Yeah.  HIM: Almost to change it.   ME: Yes. Or a 4 hour flight to the East Coast on a red eye. HIM: Yeah. But on the, in coding in general.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: As long as you catch things early enough or you're not doing something super a la carte.   ME: Uh-huh.  HIM: It's not too bad to change stuff.   ME: Oh. So there's, like, less risk in coding.  HIM: So a lot of coding is just, like, you throw stuff at a wall, see what sticks, and go from there.   ME: Oh. So there's, like, so there's, like, a little overlap or some similarities between, like, book design and coding.  HIM: I mean, because coding still requires design. It still requires, like there's still, like, an artistic sense to it. Like, there are right and wrong ways to do things, but then there are also, like, what's nice and what isn't. So.   ME: Well, that's kinda true. Like, I feel like okay. I feel like there's there's rules I feel like there's more rules in book design than there is in, like, other forms of graphic design. You know what I'm saying? Like posters and like I guess branding has a lot of rules too.  HIM: Mhmm.   ME: But like I feel like with book design it's like like are there widows and orphans? What about like rivers and valleys? And like, you know, is your like like if you have a full justified, is it like does it look weird? Is there awkward spacing? Like it has to look right and blah blah blah. And like, you know, too much leading. Not enough leading. Like, all that fun stuff. And like and then I guess like today today Bob was showing us like production stuff. Like literally there's so many choices when it comes to like book cloth and like the the like, what's it called? Like finishes. And if like you want like spot UV, like, varnish or whatever, gloss, whatever he called it, like like crazy. HIM: Mhmm.   ME: Like, I feel like I feel like in the sense of how how much variety and things and, like, I feel like external thinking goes into, like, book design.  HIM: Mhmm.   ME: It's kinda similar with, like, coding in a sense.  HIM: Yeah.  ME: Besides the whole, like, packaging of information jawns HIM: Mhmm. Yeah.   ME: You know? Interesting. But then I guess, like, the the relative permanence of book design does not really apply to coding as much. Or I I guess there's, like, more room to play?  HIM: Yeah.   ME: More flexibility. That's what I was saying. Yeah. Yeah. Do you agree?  HIM: Yeah. I agree with that.   ME: Okay. Coolbeans. And so concludes our lovely interview.  HIM: Mhmm. I love you.  ME: This has been Sherry Chou and  HIM: Philip Chou.   ME: Yaaaaaaay. We are the Chous.  HIM: Glad you remembered our last name.   ME: Shut up. Good night, everybody! HIM: I love you.   ME: I love you too."
